JDoor began as a 2022 school networking project built by two student collaborators. Version
1.0.0 is a safety-focused modernization: the unauthenticated “backdoor” prototype was replaced
by an explicit remote-support product with a visible host, local approval, encrypted transport,
bounded messages and remote control disabled by default.

> JDoor Assist is for authorized support only. It deliberately has no unattended access,
> persistence, remote shell, file transfer, webcam capture, privilege escalation, or stealth mode.

## What works

- Direct screen sharing over TLS 1.2/1.3.
- Ephemeral ECDSA certificate for every host run, bound to the advertised host through a SAN.
- Certificate fingerprint embedded in the out-of-band pairing link.
- Client endpoint identification plus constant-time matching of the exact certificate fingerprint.
- Random 128-bit, single-use pairing token with a 10-minute lifetime.
- Local approval showing the viewer name, address, and verification code.
- View-only sessions by default; the host can enable or revoke input instantly.
- Bounded, versioned binary protocol with defensive parsing, pre-TLS per-address caps, and an
  absolute setup deadline.
- Session-scoped control permission and capture cleanup that cannot migrate to a later viewer.
- Daily local JSONL audit records without pairing secrets, capped at 5 MiB with 30-day retention.
- Modern Swing UI with HiDPI support and keyboard-accessible controls.

## Run it

Prerequisites: JDK 21. The Maven Wrapper downloads the pinned Maven distribution.

```bash
./mvnw clean verify
java -jar target/jdoor-assist-1.0.0-all.jar
```

On Windows:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd clean verify
java -jar target\jdoor-assist-1.0.0-all.jar
```

From the launcher:

1. The person receiving help chooses **Share this screen**.
2. They copy the one-time `jdoor://` link through a trusted channel.
3. The helper chooses **Join a session**, pastes the link, and requests access.
4. Both devices show the verification code before approval; the host compares it and approves
   locally.
5. The session starts view-only. The host may enable mouse and keyboard control.
6. Either side can end the session; the host can revoke control at any time.

The CLI can open either role directly:

```text
java -jar target/jdoor-assist-1.0.0-all.jar --host --port 8443
java -jar target/jdoor-assist-1.0.0-all.jar --host --advertise 192.168.1.50
java -jar target/jdoor-assist-1.0.0-all.jar --join "jdoor://…"
java -jar target/jdoor-assist-1.0.0-all.jar --help
```

## Security model

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant H as Host
    participant V as Viewer
    H->>V: Pairing link via trusted channel
    V->>H: TLS handshake with endpoint identity + certificate pin
    V->>H: Single-use token + visible device name
    H->>H: Local consent prompt
    H-->>V: Approved, view-only session
    H-->>V: Optional control permission
    H->>H: Visible audit + immediate revoke
```

The direct connection is intended for a trusted LAN. JDoor Assist does not include a public
relay, NAT traversal, account system, or centralized trust service. Do not expose port 8443
directly to the internet. See [the threat model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) and
[security policy](SECURITY.md) before deploying it in a sensitive environment.

## Build and package

`mvn verify` compiles with `-Xlint:all -Werror`, runs unit and real loopback TLS integration
tests, creates a coverage report, builds the shaded JAR, and produces a CycloneDX SBOM.

Create an unsigned platform app image with JDK `jpackage`:

```powershell
.\scripts\package.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/package.sh
```

Outputs are written below `target/package/`. Community builds are currently unsigned; your OS
may show an unverified-publisher warning. Release automation also emits checksums, an SBOM, and
GitHub build provenance. Maintainers should follow the
[release procedure](docs/RELEASES.md); a successful packaging run alone does not authorize a
publication.
